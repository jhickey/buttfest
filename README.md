#Buttfest control panel

##Setup
You'll want the backend up and running first: [https://github.com/jhickey/buttfest-server]()

Install dependencies:
```
npm i
```

Then run it:
```
npm start
```

That's pretty much it!

To check the production build before deploying/opening a PR: 
```
npm run build
```
